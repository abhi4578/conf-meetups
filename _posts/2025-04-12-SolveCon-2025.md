## Introduction
SolveCon 2025 was a blast! It was a conference on solving civic, environmental, and educational problems through a youth-led movement
or to say "Solve Ninjas". The conference was a mystery for me, it unraveled during the day in a layered fashion. I learned about SolveCon 
from the [FOSSUNITED](https://fossunited.org/) community.
It had almost 300+ youth participants, most of them ranging from high school to college. Continue reading to get the
gist of what the event was about.

## Summary
This was my first time at Bangalore Creative Circus. The place is awesome, an old industry warehouse converted into a 
amazing place using recycled materials. Maybe one disadvantage is a small parking place.

The event had a strange rule, after checking in, had to deposit the mobile at the front desk for the first half, which was good in hindsight, had more time to interact with people! I have summarized the event according to the event's main three components:

### Solver's Mela
This section of the conference had stalls of SolveCon NGO partners around the main area. Each NGO was explaining the problem their trying to solve 
intriguing the crowd, how they were solving it, and finally how to get involved. The organizations that were part of the conference were:

1. [Defy](https://projectdefy.org/): Re-Imagining new education paradigm through "Nooks" - a place where people of any age gather 
 and learn collaboratively by designing their education without any teachers! Giving importance to experiential learning, freedom to learn what they want, and defining no age limit i.e. learning is a lifelong experience! It was good to meet Gurukaran from the team! Checkout the 
 [TEDx Video](https://youtu.be/g4y04sHXeDs)!
2. [Avarana](https://www.linkedin.com/company/aatree/): It was home gardening organisation. The tiny Terrarium garden encapsulated in a self-sustaining recycled glass bottle was the highlight, it was very cute and perfect for giving gifts. The best thing, it needs no water and maintenance! I bought two of them, see the end of the page to see how they look!
3. [The Maitri Arha Foundation](https://maitriarha.in/): I was astounded by very young people coming together to provide holistic education 
to all. It was inspiring to interact and learn more about the initiatives - "Nanna Kanasu". Signed up for volunteering!
4. [Mercy mission](https://mercy-mission.org/index.php): They had a nice tarot game, it was interesting to get to know that the Mental Health policy 
was created just recently, in 2014. The mission does social services and has a 9-month fellowship program for the youth.
5. [Terrum](https://terrum.in/): This organisation provides platform/spaces for other organisation and willing youth to connect and solve problems. 
6. [Reap Benefit](https://www.reapbenefit.org/): They are the backbone of SolveCon. They are a platform that is building a movement of changemakers- called ["Solve Ninjas"](https://www.reapbenefit.org/what).
7. [Apurva AI](https://apurva.ai/index.html): Organisation which puts together expert knowledge/domain experts such as healthcare, agriculture, 
energy to create a database of open-access knowledge that can be queried through an LLM.

### Solver's Jam
There were (probably) four solver's jam/expert hands-on sessions - Decoding Data for India, Marketing, Eco-Anxiety and Climate. 
I went to the Decoding Data for India, which was conducted by experts - Arpit and Apurv from [Data for India](https://www.dataforindia.com/) 
organization. 
The session opened up with three interesting questions, to get the audience data.
1) Are you from Bangalore? 
2) Which degree pursuing or pursued? Engineering was the highest
3) Mobile usage hours?

Then the session started going over various data charts and graphs. I was surprised to find out that in India, 30% i.e. majority of [Indians pursue Arts as a degree as opposed to Engineering](https://www.dataforindia.com/higher-education/). Also surprised to find stark differences in rent rates in rural and urban India and also sources of portable water - packaging water be high in Urban, modes of transport - Cycling to be most used in rural.

We also had a practical session to analyze a particular dataset in terms of groups of six-seven. We analyzed data on access to electricity in India. It is interesting to note even though Bangalore was the first place in India to get electrified, Karnataka had only 60% access in 1991 and achieved 98% in 2021. Access to electricity was slowest among the North-Eastern states and Bihar was lowest in 1991 and rapidly increased access to electricity in the last decade to 90%+. 

Overall, it was interesting, to learn different ways to look at and interpret data. 

### Changemaker Adda
This session was the highlight of the conference. It had four speakers :

1. **Kupendra**: He talked about how he led a mobilization movement against the administration to remove extra exam fees charged by Bangalore University. I liked the approach taken to solve it in incremental steps right from identifying the issue, comparing it with other colleges, talking 
to the University and then to the college, and then pressurizing the college through the student community emails and letters. He also talked about how he now works at plastic recycling and what plastics get recycled to - sheets, chairs. 

2. **Aishwarya**: She was an impressive changemaker in waste dumping. She led a community campaign to transform three black spots (places where one or more types of waste are dumped in the residential area causing major inconvenience and diseases). She detailed what [methodology](https://www.reapbenefit.org/what) she used - discover, basically all neighborhood areas where this is happening, investigate how and why, causes of dumping, solve the problem through community campaigning and getting waste collected through BBMP officials and share this to the community. 
She also detailed how Reap Benefit helped to resolve this hyper-local issue. Her words - "Change starts with us" and "Small actions brings big changes" were inspiring. 

3. **Akash**: Akash from [Avarana](https://www.linkedin.com/company/aatree/), spoke about his journey from being a hobbyist in gardening to spreading gardening in urban spaces. He also talked about the idea of creating a terrarium using used glass bottles. 

4. **Shivakumar**: Shivakamur from [Outlawed India](https://www.outlawedindia.com/) spoke about the extortion from one of the LGBTQ community which inspired him to fight for LGBTQ rights. His company specializes in para-legal advising for vulnerable communities in various areas like litigation, scholarships, employment, rights, etc.

## Takeaways
Before I came here, I always wanted to volunteer and work for civic, and climate causes, but didn't know **HOW**? I feel the major takeaway was that there are many like-minded people actively working in these areas, and got connected to different organsiation and have more clarity on how to contribute. Youth has a lot of potential and consciously going from apathy to small actions towards civic and climate issues can make a huge differnce.
