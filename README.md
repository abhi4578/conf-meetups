# conf-meetups

All my learnings from conferences, meetups and possibly my talks, workshops goes here!

## Motivations

My motivations to have a website dedicated to conference, meetups

1. I have a learned a lot from meetups, conferences, workshops.
But haven't found a way to document/notes of it in efficient way, so
that I can access any time I want. Usually I lose my books.
2. I like to share. The more I share, more I learn!
3. Practice tech and content writing skills! Maybe take it as
a job when coding gets stressful!
