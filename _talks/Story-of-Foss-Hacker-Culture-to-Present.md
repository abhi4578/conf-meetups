## Session Description

This session will trace the intriguing story of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) from its origins to the present, exploring the challenges and triumphs that shaped its evolution. It will cover:

- **Origins of FOSS**: Delve into its history from early computers, Unix, hacker culture, jargon file, and the Free Software movement, GNU, X-System, BSD. I will discuss the critical "four freedoms," highlighted by moments like Bill Gates' letter and the MIT lab printer anecdote.

- **The Open Source Boom**: Explore the rise of Linux, Apache, and Red Hat, the definition of open source, and the evolution of FOSS business models. I'll contrast the "Cathedral vs. Bazaar" development model, drawing parallels to Android vs. Kubernetes, and discuss the philosophical differences between Free Software and Open Source.

- **FOSS in India**: Briefly explore the journey of FOSS communities in India, including SMC, FSF India, Linux User Groups, Debian, and FSCI, along with their unique challenges and this current community.

- **FOSS Today & Future Challenges**: Address current FOSS landscapes - rise of foundations - Apache, Eclipse, Linux, CNCF etc., Kubernetes, Public Money Public Code, Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), Deepseek, and the growing challenge of FOSS baiting. I'll also touch upon the vital topics of women in FOSS, diversity, and the intersection of FOSS with AI.

Finally, conclude why FOSS is a force of innovation even in these changing times!

Caution: I am young in this space, but have been exploring and am part of a few communities over the last 6 years. Please bear my mistakes while bringing this out, appreciate any collaboration, and support from the community for this history talk!
